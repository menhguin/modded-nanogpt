Here are the complete instructions from the image for creating your first Modal app:

1. Download and configure the Python client
Run these commands to install the Python library locally:
```bash
$ pip install modal
$ python3 -m modal setup
```

The first command installs the Modal client library and its dependencies.
The second command creates an API token by authenticating through your web browser. It will open a new tab, which you can close when done.

2. Run some code
You're ready to run some code! Here's a minimal script that computes the square of 42:

```python
import modal

app = modal.App("example-get-started")

@app.function()
def square(x):
    print("This code is running on a remote worker!")
    return x**2

@app.local_entrypoint()
def main():
    print("the square is", square.remote(42))
```

Save the code to a local file:
```bash
$ cat > get_started.py # At the prompt, paste the snippet and Ctrl-D to save i
```

Now run it:
```bash
$ modal run get_started.py
```

Congratulations, you successfully executed a function on a remote worker!
